Hi! If you are reading this you are either forking this or I have invited you to work with me on this project! This is a simple bot I made for my friends to post answers!

How to add new answers:
1. Go to main.py
2. Copy and paste this line of code:
if msg.startswith('What are the answers for (this work)?':
    await message.channel.send('Enter the answer here')
3. Done!
