# AnswerBot
AnswerBot is a Discord Bot made by Baddymax and Splode for a group of school friends. There's really nothing too 
special about this whatsoever. Credit to some random article for helping me learn this crap.

# How it works

This works pretty simple. By using the Message event, it detects if someone says a "command"
(e.g "!commands"),  and it replies with an  embed (e.g "Here are my commands: etc."). I know I could just use
from discord.ext import commands but fuck that man. I can't even get it to work, i'm a dumbass.

# Conclusions

Why are you even here in the first place? This is just some terrible bot I made, man.
There is literally no point in being here.
